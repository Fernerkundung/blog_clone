### This blog

This blog will contain interesting tidbits about remote sensing, python programming, GIS and related topics acquired during the course of my PhD thesis in the field of remote sensing. *Fernerkundung* is the German name for Remote Sesing - The scanning of the earth by satellite or high-flying aircraft in order to obtain information about it.

### Me

Apart from geography I'm passionate about anything on two wheels, own *n+1* bicycles, a motorbike, like to cook and enjoy good food and spoil my dog.
