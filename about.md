### This blog

This blog is about remote sensing, python programming, GIS and related topics I encounter during the course of my PhD thesis in the field of remote sensing. *Fernerkundung* is the German name for Remote Sesing - The scanning of the earth by satellite or high-flying aircraft in order to obtain information about it.

### Me

Apart from geography I'm passionate about anything on two wheels, own *n+1* bicycles, a motorbike, like to cook, enjoy good food and spoil my dog.
