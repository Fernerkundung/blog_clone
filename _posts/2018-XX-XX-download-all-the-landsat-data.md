- recent news indicate, that Landsat data might not be freely distributed in the future: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04874-y
- I was wondering - how long would it take for me to mirror the publicly available data


### Download all the Landsat data

The idea that some people might have now is to download all the data while they can - but how long would that take?


- Google BigQuery analysis (Google has more Landsat data than USGS - mostly Landsat)
- table

- download assumptions (storage&speed) as a list
	- 3.5 PB (copmpressed) / 7 PB (uncompressed) of usable storage
	- 1Gbit/s connection
	- download from Google Public dataset w/o throttling
- table of download time

- conclusion how many days it would take *at least* to download all the data
