### Me

My name is Kersten. I'm a PhD student living in Munich. Apart from data sciences and geography I'm passionate about anything on two wheels, own n+1 bicycles, a motorbike, like to cook, enjoy good food and spoil my dog.


### This blog

This blog is about Remote Sensing, Python programming, GIS and related topics I encounter during the course of my PhD thesis in the field of Remote Sensing.

*Fernerkundung* is the German name for Remote Sensing - The scanning of the earth by satellite or high-flying aircraft in order to obtain information about it.
